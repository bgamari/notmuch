.TH NOTMUCH-DUMP 1 2012-06-01 "Notmuch 0.13.2"
.SH NAME
notmuch-dump \- creates a plain-text dump of the tags of each message

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B "notmuch dump"
.RI "[ --output=<" filename "> ] [--]"
.RI "[ <" search-term ">...]"

.SH DESCRIPTION

Dump tags for messages matching the given search terms.

Output is to the given filename, if any, or to stdout.

These tags are the only data in the notmuch database that can't be
recreated from the messages themselves.  The output of notmuch dump is
therefore the only critical thing to backup (and much more friendly to
incremental backup than the native database files.)

With no search terms, a dump of all messages in the database will be
generated.  A "--" argument instructs notmuch that the
remaining arguments are search terms.

See \fBnotmuch-search-terms\fR(7)
for details of the supported syntax for <search-terms>.
