.SH NAME
notmuch-compact \- compact the notmuch database
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B notmuch compact

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B compact
command can be used to compact the notmuch database. This can both reduce
the space required by the database and improve lookup performance.

The compacted database is built in a temporary directory and is later
moved into the place of the origin database. The original uncompacted
database is preserved to be deleted by the user as desired.

Note that the database write lock will be held during the compaction
process (which may be quite long) to protect data integrity.

use ${HOME}/.notmuch\-config if this variable is not set.
