.TH NOTMUCH-TAG 1 2012-08-20 "Notmuch 0.14"
.SH NAME
notmuch-tag \- add/remove tags for all messages matching the search terms

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B notmuch tag
.RI  "+<" tag> "|\-<" tag "> [...] [\-\-] <" search-term ">..."

.SH DESCRIPTION

Add/remove tags for all messages matching the search terms.

See \fBnotmuch-search-terms\fR(7)
for details of the supported syntax for <search-terms>.

Tags prefixed by '+' are added while those prefixed by '\-' are
removed. For each message, tag removal is performed before tag
addition.

The beginning of <search-terms> is recognized by the first
argument that begins with neither '+' nor '\-'. Support for
an initial search term beginning with '+' or '\-' is provided
by allowing the user to specify a "\-\-" argument to separate
the tags from the search terms.

.B "notmuch tag"
updates the maildir flags according to tag changes if the
.B "maildir.synchronize_flags"
configuration option is enabled. See \fBnotmuch-config\fR(1) for
details.
